# Headless CMS Template Creation with MeiliSearch Indexing

## Project Overview

This project is a Laravel-based application for creating and managing templates within a headless CMS. It implements a full workflow for defining and saving templates along with their custom fields. Once a template is created, it is queued for indexing in MeiliSearch through a background job, allowing for efficient search functionality while keeping the user interface responsive.

The system enables users to easily define and manage templates, while the queued indexing job asynchronously updates MeiliSearch to reflect new or updated templates.

## Key Functionalities

- **Template and Field Creation**: Allows users to define, save, and customize templates with specific fields in the headless CMS.
- **Asynchronous MeiliSearch Indexing**: Templates and their fields are added to MeiliSearch through a background job, ensuring efficient indexing without interrupting the user experience.
- **Robust Workflow Management**: Supports the entire template lifecycle, from creation to background indexing, making content management streamlined and efficient.
